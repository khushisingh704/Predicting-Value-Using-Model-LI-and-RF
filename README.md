    This project will focus on splitting and training the dataset using LinearRegression and Random Forest models.<br>
    It will preprocess the data to ensure optimalmodel performance.<br>
    The trained models will then be used to make predictions on the test data.<br>
    Additionally, the project will compare the predicted and actual values for both models.<br>
    The results will be visualized using scatter plots to analyze performance differences. Finally, key insights will be drawn based on the comparison of the two models.
